# Polynomial-operations-in-Scheme
A few procedures for working with univariate polynomials implemented in Scheme.

This is just a small project I did to get some experience with Scheme.

The data structure used for polynomials is just a list where the indices are the powers of the monomials and the contents are the corresponding coefficients.
